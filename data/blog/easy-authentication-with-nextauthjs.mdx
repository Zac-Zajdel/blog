# What is NextAuth.js?

NextAuth.js is an extremely powerful and easy to use solution for authentication users for your Next.js application.
With support for popular databases such as MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB, there is a good chance you will be up and
running with authentication for your application in no time.

For this example, we will be using Google OAuth 2.0 as our provider and Prisma for our adapter.
However following the links for a list of other [providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) and
[adapters](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) to match your application. Let's get started!

## Setting up your Google Cloud Console Configurations

Before we get started, we need to sign into our Google Account and access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
From there take the following steps:

1. Create a new project.
2. Then navigate to APIs and Services on the sidebar and select the credentials.
3. Choose CREATE CREDENTIALS and select OAuth client ID
4. You will then need to configure your URI to http://localhost
5. Set your Authorized redirect URI to http://localhost/api/auth/callback/google
6. Generate your client id and client secret and make sure to save these somewhere on your computer. We are gonna need these next.

## Settings up the Prisma adapter

1. Make sure the following packages are added to your application:

```js
yarn add next-auth @prisma/client @next-auth/prisma-adapter
```

2. Create a .env file in the root directory of your application and add the client id and secret you received from Google in the previous steps as such:

```js
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'
```

3. Create a [...nextauth].ts file inside of the 'pages/api/auth' directory and add the following:

```js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export default NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
})
```
