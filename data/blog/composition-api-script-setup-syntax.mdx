# What is `<script setup>`?

This syntax was recently introduced into the Vue ecosystem to write components with much less boilerplate!
This syntactic sugar under the hood is compiled down to the regular `setup()` syntax so this is purely for the benefit of us developers.

## Let's take a quick look into the syntax

```js
<template>
  <span @click="updateTitle">{{ title }}</span>
</template>
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const title = ref('foo')

function updateTitle () {
  return title = 'bar'
}
</script>
```

Isn't that neat? A couple things to notice here:

1. That remaining `setup()` syntax no longer is needed.
2. We didn't have to return the method or ref. This is because it is automatically bounded to the template!

Now this is just scratching the surface of what this syntax has given us developers.
Go check out the official [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#basic-syntax).

TL;DR

- Simpler & cleaner Code
- `setup()` and returning the all bindings is now gone!
